		<ul>
		<li>Q. How can I request custom artwork?
		<p class="answers">My contact info is on the<a href="contactme.html">Contact Me</a>page. I use Snapchat and e-mail the most, so I'll likely respond more quickly that way.</p></li>
		<li>Q. What are the options for requesting a custom piece?
		<p class="answers">Pretty much whatever you want. I have all kinds of paint (oil, acrylic, watercolor, gouache) and whatever I don't have I can buy. If you have a specific canvas in mind (clothes / shoes / wood / etc) just let me know and I will purchase them. I can also do digital painting on my Wacom tablet.</p></li>
		<li>Q. Can I buy pieces displayed in the<a href="gallery.html">Gallery?</a>
		<p class="answers">That depends! Just ask me and I'll let you know. Some of the art displayed has already been sold, but any original drawings or prints are indeed for sale.
		</p></li>
		<li>Q. How much do paintings cost?
		<p class="answers">For custom pieces, the price depends on the materials and size of the work. That said, prints of existing pieces are $10 each if you wanna save some money.</p></li>
		<li>Q. How long until I receive my custom order?
		<p class="answers">I usually complete small-to-medium sized paintings in a couple days. If you live far away I will ship them to you.</p></li>
		<li>Q. How can I pay for artwork?
		<p class="answers">I have PayPal (@dianavera1996) and Venmo (@Diana-Vera-2). I also accept payment via Facebook (Diana Vera) and Snapchat (@dianaxdiana), or just plain ol' cash works fine too.</p></li>
