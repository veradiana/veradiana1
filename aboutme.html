	My name is Diana Vera, and I'm a self-taught artist <br>based in Chicago, Illinois. I'm currently pursuing a <br>degree in software but art will forever be my passion. <br>Any time I'm not busy with school, I create custom <br>paintings and drawings for people who enjoy my work. <br>I use watercolor, acrylic, and oil paints on a variety<br>of surfaces, as well as ink and graphite drawings. <br><br>You can read more on the<a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>page. <br>If you're looking to request a piece OR <br>you're another artist looking to collaborate,<br><a href="contactme.html">Hit me up</a>on social media. <br>I'm always open to try new things, <br>so if you've got ideas I'd love to hear them! <br>
